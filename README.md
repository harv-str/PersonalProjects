# PersonalProjects
Personal projects I have made to improve software engineering skills
- weather app:
- Made using Python
- Uses fstrings, custom tkinter(for a modern GUI), apis for both country names and weather conditions
- Librarys used: requests(for apis) , customtkinter
- problems faced: The order of code matters for customtkinter such as the mainloop() needing to be at the end or the font I created before any time it is used
